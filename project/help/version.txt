To upgrade to a new version of SMCE-Godot, you have very little to do:

Debian-based GNU/Linux: Install the latest .deb; dkpg will upgrade for you
macOS: Remove SMCE-Godot from the Applications directory, and install the latest .dmg
Windows: Simply download the latest .msi and install it; the installer will automatically take care of upgrading.
